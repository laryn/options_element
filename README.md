# Options Element

*Status*: This project is no longer needed as of Backdrop 1.12 since the 
functionality has been added in core.

Options Element is a module that provides a better mechanism to specify select 
list, checkbox, and radio button options. Rather than requiring the user to use 
strange syntax like "key|value" in a textarea, Options Element provides a clean 
interface for specifying options. Developers may use $element['#type'] = 
'options' in their own modules. If JavaScript is disabled, any 'options_element' 
will degrade to the standard textarea for specifying options.
